This brief report is intended to examine the differences in PyBer's performance in urban, suburban and rural settings.  We examined revenue, number of trips, and number of drivers in each setting using data for the first four months of 2019.  This included 2,375 trips that generated $63,538 in revenue.  Rides, Drivers, and Average fare per ride and per driver across the type of metro area are shown in this table:  

Total Rides	Total Drivers	Average Fare Per Ride	Average Fare Per Driver
Rural	125	78	$34.62	$55.49
Suburban	625	490	$30.97	$39.50
Urban	1,625	2,405	$24.53	$16.57

Increased population density led predictably to shorter but more trips in urban areas, generating lower average fares per trip.  Urban areas accounted for 68.4% of rides, but only 62.7% of revenue.  On the opposite end of the spectrum, the 5.2% of rides in rural areas generated 6.8% of revenue.

While these resultsi indicate higher demand for PyBer's services in urban areas, perhaps the most interesting fact revealed in the analysis is that there is a higher supply of drivers in urban areas.  Indeed while 78 drivers in rural areas were engaged in conducting the 125 rides, in urban areas drive outnumbered rides by 2,405 compared to only 1,625 rides.

Summary and recommendations:
* Carefully examine cmpensation scheme and performance metrics for drivers, particularly in urban areas.  Revenue per driver in urban areas lags and compensation should be commensurately adjusted.
* Seek opportunities to expand rural service, as it generates more revenue per ride.  There are clearly limits, but recognition that the service is available can probaly be improved.
* Agressively court suburban riders: they are under-represented in PyBer's ridership compared to the population at large and getting them out of personally owned vehicles and into shared ride services would not only be good for PyBer's business but would offer a host of other societal benefits.
